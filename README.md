This project was created as part of my Full Stack Developer course with the Code Institute. The project is a milestone project designed to showcase what I have learned over my three months of study so far.

In particular the project will highlight good 'User Centric' practices, utilising:
* HTML
* CSS
* BootStrap 4
* GitHub
* GitPod

The project itself is a portfolio site, for previous video production work. The site is designed to present my work and image in the best possible way to clients, encouraging them to get in touch for work.

## The User Experience ##

As this is a portfolio site, primarily based on video content, there needs to be a strong visual empthasis throughout the website on content as part of the user journey. 

This will help inform the entire User Experience by presenting the material in the best possible  way, while simultaneously encouraging site viewers to get in touch.

* The User Journey
    * First Time Users
        1. The goal for first time users is to get them familiar with my video production work, with it presented well and in a fashion that is easy to navigate.
        2. For a first time user, the content needs to be displayed for them in the best possible way, based on their device.
        3. To instil confidence and encourage potential job bookings with first time users, the site needs to present myself and work with professionalism, and utilise previous work, CV, and testimonials.
        4. For users, I would also like clear calls to action and links, to guide them to a position in which they get in touch and engage with my business.
    * Returning Users
        1. For returning users, it is important that they have quick access to contacting myself, through the site and social media links.
        2. It is also important to ensure that there is extra information regarding the specifics of each project displayed on the site. This, in a manner that doesn't detract from the streamlined expereince of a first time user.

### User Journey Flowchart ###

![The User Journey](/assets/readme_images/user_journey.png)

* Design
    * Layout
        * The site will be displayed in a way that is optimised for mobiles first, but is responsive and adjusts accordingly to desktop screens. This will be done utilising BootStrap 4's grid system, and media queries.
        * The layout will place an empthasis on videos where they are displayed, ensuring that the user expereiences them in the best posible way, and presents the portfolio in the best light.
        * There will be call to action buttons used throughout the design to encourage the user journey of first time users.
    * Colors
        * The colors used on the site should follow existing personal branding. In this case, a color pallete has been created with the exact hex values of these colors.
        * Additional considerations have been made for links, to ensure that they respond aesthetically in a clear way that gels with the design. In that respect, an additional 'Hover' colour was added to the pallete.
        ![Color Pallete](/assets/readme_images/colors.png)
    * Video
        * All video content used on the site will come from my own work and portfolio.
        * With the empthasis on video, this site needs to display content in the best possible way. Portfolio video content will be hosted on Vimeo, as Vimeo provides excellent image quality and responsive embed features.
        * All additional content that is to be uploaded to Vimeo will be exported from Adobe Premiere Pro using the highest quality Vimeo preset, to enusre maximum viewing quality.
        * For HTML5 video content, video will be rendered through Adobe Premiere Pro presets that empthasise quality, but not at the cost of overall site performance, rendering at reasonable bitrates to ensure fast loading.
        * The landing page will feature two seperate videos based on the type of device you are visiting on. Mobile users will see a dedicated 720p portrait video. Desktop and tablet users will see a dedicated 1080p landscape video. 
        This will ensure that video content is designed properly for mobile and desktop.
    * Images
        * All images used on this site will come from my own design and photography assets.
        * Any assets will be put through Adobe Photoshop and sized according to their function. Maintaining visual quality, but empthasising performance on the site.
        * The images chosen will be the ones with the most visual appeal, that will display best on both mobile and desktop.
        * The testimonial section will have several image carousel slides that will be specially designed and put together within Adobe Photoshop.
        * The website will use an updated version of my logo in a .png format.
    * Typeography
        * The webiste will utilise Google Fonts for its type, and default back to sans-serif in the event the Google fonts cannot load.
        * The content text will use the 'Lato' font. This font displays well on both mobile and desktop devices, allowing for a pleasant reading expereince.
        * Headings will use the 'Oswalt' font. This compliaments the 'Lato' font well, and displays strongly on mobile and desktop devices in headings.

## Testing ##

Testing was completed for this project primarily using Google Chrome's developer tools throughout the project.

The project was also tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Due to the project being developed on the Windows platform, access to Safari and Apple devices has been limmited.

Aditional testing was attempted on browserstack.com, however this was only limmited due to the small access that a free account provides.

This project was further tested on several members of my family across multiple devices.

### User Journey Testing ###

* First Time Users
    1. The goal for first time users is to get them familiar with my video production work, with it presented well and in a fashion that is easy to navigate. 
        * Navigiation is clear, with users quickly able to navigate on mobile and desktop nav bars. Content is presented strongly to the users and is large and empthasised on each page.
    2. For a first time user, the content needs to be displayed for them in the best possible way, based on their device.
        * The landing screen has two videos specially edited and tailored to show on appropriate devices. The video content is edited specifically to look best on the given device.
        * Video content has been rendered at appropriate bitrates to ensure quality. It has then been hosted on a service that maintains said quality.
    3. To instil confidence and encourage potential job bookings with first time users, the site needs to present myself and work with professionalism, and utilise previous work, CV, and testimonials.
        * The website showcases a consistent, and professional looking design for users, while aptly presenting relevent information to employers, this through consistent visual language, and structured content.
        * The user has quick access to my CV and a means of contacting me on every page.
    4. For users, I would also like clear calls to action and links, to guide them to a position in which they get in touch and engage with my business.
        * Calls to action are presented on every page, encouraging a clear user journey, from the home page with the end goal of getting potential employers to click the contact me call to action or download my CV.
        * Calls to action are made large and have clear icons to grab the users attention and make their function clear.
* Returning Users
    1. For returning users, it is important that they have quick access to contacting myself, through the site and social media links.
        * There is a means of contacting me via all available means on every page, either via the contact me form, or the social media links at the bottom of the page.
        * Quick access to the relevant means of contact is achieved by having the footer display my social media accounts on every page, as  well as having the contact me modal featured on the navigation bar.
    2. It is also important to ensure that there is extra information regarding the specifics of each project displayed on the site. This, in a manner that doesn't detract from the streamlined expereince of a first time user.
        * The addition of the collapse components on the portfolio page allows users to access relevant information regarding certain projects without affecting the visual experience for someone who simply wishes to view the video.
        * Presenting the information with the collapse component also provides benefits over using a modal, as the user's viewing experience of the video is less obstructed.

###  Known Bugs ###
* Landing screen videos  won't appear  on  iOS  devices. (During BrowserStack testing.)

* Content doesn't properly fit within boxes on the "About" page on newer mobile devices with wider resolutions.
